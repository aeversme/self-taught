# The Self-Taught Programmer/Computer Scientist

---

_WIP_

This is a repository for code I authored as I worked through Cory Althoff's _The Self-Taught Programmer_ and _The 
Self-Taught Computer Scientist_.

Code written in `self-taught-programmer` focuses primarily on Object-Oriented Programming, including a class-based 
version of the card game 'War.' There are also a few rudimentary data structures (LIFO stack, FIFO queue) in the `CS` 
subfolder.
